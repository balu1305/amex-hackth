# AMEX Round 2 Setup Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\T VIJAYA BALAJI\Desktop\AMEX\r2"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AMEX Campus Challenge Round 2 - Employee Psychology Model"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `AMEX-Round2-Offer-Prediction`
4. Description: `Employee Psychology-Driven Approach to Predicting Customer Offer Interactions - AMEX Campus Challenge Round 2`
5. Set to Public (to showcase your work)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AMEX-Round2-Offer-Prediction.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Upload
1. Check your GitHub repository page
2. Verify all files are uploaded
3. Check that README.md displays properly
4. Confirm repository structure matches expectations

## Important Notes

### Data Files
- **NOT included in Git**: All `.parquet` and large `.csv` files are in `.gitignore`
- **Reason**: GitHub has file size limits and data files are competition-specific
- **Documentation**: Data structure and sources are documented in README.md

### Model Files
- **Included**: All Python model scripts
- **Purpose**: Showcase methodology and allow reproduction
- **Documentation**: Each model is explained in methodology.md

### Submission Files
- **Location**: `submissions/` directory
- **Content**: Generated CSV files for competition submission
- **Note**: These demonstrate final results but contain test predictions

## Next Steps After GitHub Upload

### 1. Repository Enhancements
```bash
# Add repository topics/tags for discoverability
# Go to repository settings on GitHub and add topics:
# - machine-learning
# - lightgbm
# - amex-challenge
# - employee-psychology
# - binary-classification
```

### 2. Create Release
1. Go to "Releases" section on GitHub
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0`
4. Title: `AMEX Round 2 - Employee Psychology Model (0.8474 AUC)`
5. Description: Summary of achievements and key files

### 3. Update Profile README
Add this project to your GitHub profile README:
```markdown
## 🏆 Featured Project: AMEX Campus Challenge Round 2
**Employee Psychology-Driven Offer Prediction** - Improved from 0.154 to 0.8474 AUC using behavioral insights and conservative machine learning.

## Sharing Your Work

### LinkedIn Post Template
```
🏆 Completed AMEX Campus Challenge Round 2!

Key Achievement: Improved model performance from 0.154 to 0.8474 AUC (448% improvement)

💡 Breakthrough Insight: Treating customers as "working employees" rather than abstract data points led to psychology-based feature engineering that significantly outperformed complex mathematical transformations.

🛠️ Technical Highlights:
✅ Fixed critical data type issues (binary strings → numerical targets)
✅ Implemented employee behavior modeling (evening activity, engagement patterns)  
✅ Applied extreme overfitting prevention (conservative LightGBM parameters)
✅ Achieved excellent cross-validation consistency (±0.0010 AUC)

🔍 Key Lessons:
• Domain understanding > Mathematical complexity
• Cross-validation consistency > Peak validation scores  
• Simple psychology-based features > Complex transformations
• Conservative approaches often generalize better
