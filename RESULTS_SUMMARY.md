# AMEX Round 2 - Results Summary & Next Steps

## ðŸŽ‰ Baseline Results
**Validation AUC: 0.9469** - This is an excellent baseline!

### Key Insights from Baseline Model:

#### Top 10 Most Important Features:
1. **f366**: CM's past 6 month CTR on relevant offers
2. **f350**: Time of day (seconds after 00:00 hrs)
3. **f207**: Number of impressions in the last 30 days
4. **f223**: Difference between offer start and rollup date
5. **f363**: CTR on incoming offer's industry (past 180 days)
6. **f204**: Ratio of decaying clicks to impressions (14 days, merchant)
7. **f38**: Number of successfully sent direct emails (180 days)
8. **f203**: Ratio of decaying clicks to impressions (30 days, non-merchant)
9. **f77**: Page view ratio (30 days to 180 days)
10. **f206**: Number of clicks in past 30 days

#### Key Patterns:
- **Temporal features are crucial**: Time of day, offer timing
- **Historical engagement matters**: Past CTR, clicks, impressions
- **Recent activity is important**: 30-day metrics perform well
- **Personalization works**: Customer-specific behavior patterns

## ðŸ“Š Files Created:
1. `quick_submission.csv` - Your first submission (AUC: 0.9469)
2. `round2_analysis.py` - Comprehensive analysis script
3. `quick_start.py` - Baseline model
4. `README.md` - Complete guide

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Improve Performance:

### 1. Immediate Improvements (Run these next):

```bash
# Run the comprehensive analysis
python round2_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Add feature engineering from additional datasets
- Create interaction features
- Use more sophisticated model parameters
- Generate `submission_round2.csv`

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering:

#### A. Temporal Features:
- Hour of day bins (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- Day of week patterns
- Time since last interaction
- Seasonal patterns

#### B. Customer Segmentation:
```python
# Create customer value segments
df['customer_value'] = pd.qcut(df['total_spend'], q=5, labels=['low','med-low','med','med-high','high'])

# Engagement level based on past CTR
df['engagement_level'] = pd.qcut(df['avg_ctr'], q=3, labels=['low','medium','high'])
```

#### C. Offer Characteristics:
- Offer category affinity per customer
- Discount value relative to customer spending
- Offer duration vs customer preference

### 3. Model Improvements:

#### A. Hyperparameter Tuning:
```python
# Better LightGBM parameters
lgb_params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'auc',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 64,
    'learning_rate': 0.01,
    'feature_fraction': 0.7,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.7,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'min_data_in_leaf': 50,
    'lambda_l1': 0.1,
    'lambda_l2': 0.1,
    'verbose': -1,
    'is_unbalance': True,
    'random_state': 42
}
```

#### B. Ensemble Methods:
- Combine LightGBM + XGBoost + CatBoost
- Different feature subsets for each model
- Stack with a meta-learner

### 4. Cross-Validation Strategy:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

# 5-fold stratified CV
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
cv_scores = []

for fold, (train_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(skf.split(X, y)):
    X_train_fold, X_val_fold = X.iloc[train_idx], X.iloc[val_idx]
    y_train_fold, y_val_fold = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[val_idx]
    # Train and validate
```

### 5. Expected Performance Targets:

- **Current Baseline**: 0.9469 AUC
- **With Feature Engineering**: 0.950+ AUC  
- **With Hyperparameter Tuning**: 0.955+ AUC
- **With Ensemble**: 0.960+ AUC

### 6. Quick Wins to Try:

#### A. Feature Interactions:
```python
# CTR momentum
df['ctr_trend'] = df['f310'] / (df['f314'] + 1e-8)  # 1-day vs 30-day CTR

# Customer-Offer fit
df['offer_customer_match'] = df['customer_spend_category'] * df['offer_category_score']

# Time-based interactions
df['time_engagement'] = df['f350'] * df['avg_ctr']  # Time of day * engagement
```

#### B. Missing Value Engineering:
```python
# Create 'missingness' features
for col in ['f43', 'f47', 'f168']:  # Important features with missing values
    df[f'{col}_is_missing'] = df[col].isnull().astype(int)
```

### 7. Debugging and Monitoring:

```python
# Feature correlation analysis
corr_matrix = df[feature_cols].corr()
high_corr = corr_matrix[abs(corr_matrix) > 0.9]

# Feature stability across time
df['time_bin'] = pd.qcut(df['id4'], q=5)
stability_check = df.groupby('time_bin')[top_features].mean()
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Action Plan:

1. **Today**: Run `python round2_analysis.py` for improved submission
2. **This Week**: 
   - Add customer segmentation features
   - Try hyperparameter tuning
   - Implement cross-validation
3. **Advanced**: 
   - Build ensemble models
   - Create custom evaluation metrics
   - Optimize business-specific thresholds

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:

1. **Monitor Validation**: Always check that validation AUC tracks with improvements
2. **Feature Selection**: Remove low-importance and highly correlated features
3. **Business Context**: Remember this is about ranking offers, not just classification
4. **Submission Strategy**: Submit multiple models and track leaderboard feedback

Your baseline of **0.9469 AUC is already very strong!** Focus on incremental improvements and robust validation.
